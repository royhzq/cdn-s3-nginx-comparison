    "It is not immediately obvious if a CDN will be beneficial for applications serving solely serving the Singapore market. In AWS, the S3 service stores files in specific regions. And in South-East Asia region, AWS only has data centers in Singapore. Likewise, it's CDN service will serve the same files through the same data centers (together with edge locations). For each region (including Singapore), AWS maintains 3 availability zones. These zones contain one or more data centers and each zone is separated by a significant distance to spread the risk of a disaster bringing down all zones at once. This means that in the Singapore, one availability zone may be in Jurong area and the other in Tampines. The distance could be around ~20km."
