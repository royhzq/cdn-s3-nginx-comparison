   "source": [
    "It is common practice to deploy a CDN to speed up the delivery of static content, and in most cases, the CDN does the job well by caching the content on geographically distributed servers. However, for an application solely serving a local region such as Singapore, the benefits of using a CDN are diminished."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "This analysis has shown statistically that serving static content in the Singapore region through a CDN (CloudFront) can in fact be slower than through a basic cloud storage service (AWS S3). In addition, our analysis also suggests that a Nginx static file server outperforms both the CDN and the cloud storage service in this area. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "However, a few caveats are in order. The response times are recorded via network requests through a local machine, vpn, and ec2 instances. These timings may not be representative of the typical user experience as the variation in origin locations of the experimental requests are quite limited. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "These comparisons are also conducted solely on AWS infrastructure. Using other service providers may yield different results. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Lastly, the performance of the Nginx server is likely biased downwards (faster) as the requests to the file server are HTTP based, as compared to HTTPS on S3 and CloudFront. Enabling HTTPS on the Nginx file server would be a fairer comparison against the other methods as the time taken for the SSL/TLS handshake is not insignificant at the millisecond scale. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "There are many other factors to consider when choosing between the different content delivery methods, with speed being only one consideration. Cloud storage and CDN provide other benefits such as being highly available and redundant. Decoupling the serving of static files from your main application is also a good practice. Nevertheless, the results of this study do suggest that if speed is the main consideration, then perhaps a CDN may not be all that effective when serving a small local region such as Singapore."
